# Javascript Handbook for Beginners
## Key JS Concepts

###### Everything in *Javascript* happens inside an **Execution Context**.

**Execution Context** - It is like a big box and has two components in it. The first component is known as memory component. The memory component stores all the variables and functions as the key value pairs. It is also known as variable enviornment. The second component of this execution context is called code component. In this place all the code is executed one line at a time. The other name for it is thread of execution.

*Javascript* is a synchronous single-threaded language.
